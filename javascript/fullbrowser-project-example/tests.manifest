CACHE MANIFEST

#
# A list of the resources that browsers should cache to have
# the application running completely offline.
#
# To update offline instances of the application, this file needs
# to be modified, either in the list or in the comments.
#
# To understand how all this works, read http://appcachefacts.info/
# and the linked references.
